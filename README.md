# Simple_Calculator
This is a simple calculator GUI made in tkinter. It performs basic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
This program is part of the programmer's learning about the GUI applications. Since Python is widely used, I decided to use it as my
programming language for GUI projects.
